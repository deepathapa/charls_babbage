    <h2>Lived 1791 - 1871</h2>
    <p>Do you ever wonder who you have to thank for the powerful desktop or laptop you
      are now using for practically everything you do? You might say all thanks should
      be given to the computer companies of today but in fact, you have Charles Babbage to thank.
       The name might not be familiar to you just yet but read on because pretty soon,
        “Charles Babbage” will be on your mind every time you use your computer.</p>


<h1>Who is Charles Babbage?</h1>
<p>Charles Babbage was born on Dec. 26, 1791 in England. He was a polymath and became a mathematician, mechanical engineer, inventor, and philosopher. He contributed to many different scientific fields but his most famous work is designing a programmable computing device</p>
<p>Charles Babbage is considered the “father of the computer” and is given credit for devising the first ever mechanical computer. His design served as the blue print for other, more complex machines.</p>
<h1>His early life</h1>
<p>There is some dispute about the birthplace of Charles Babbage but as stated in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Babbage was born at 44 Crosby Row at Walworth Road in London, England. A blue plaque has been placed along the junction of Walworth Road and Larcom Street to commemorate the birth of this brilliant man.</p>
<p>Charles Babbage was one of four children born to Betsy Plumleigh Teape and Benjamin Babbage. His father was a banker and he was the partner of William Praed. Together they founded Praed’s & Co. of Fleet Street London in 1801.</p>
<h1>Babbage and his machines</h1>
<p>Mathematical tables were important in Babbage’s era for use in navigation, science and engineering. They were calculated by hand and then compiled into tables. Errors were sometimes made either in the calculation or in the compiling of the tables.</p>
<p>It is with this background that Babbage decided to design a mechanical device that could perform calculations. Such a machine would always be accurate and would save time and money.</p>
<h1>Personal and Death</h1>
<p>In 1814, Babbage married Georgiana Whitmore. They had eight children together, but only three lived beyond childhood. His wife died in 1827.

Charles Babbage died on Oct. 18, 1871, aged 79. He is buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery in London. Cause of death was “renal inadequacy”.</p>
